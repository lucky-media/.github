## 🍿 Fun facts
`Isnification` is the word we use when the designer gets the design ready for development. The idea came from `Art` (Yes, that's his name), our first designer ( Yes, our designer is named Art 🤷‍♂️ ), who was working with a developer called **Isni**. Nowadays we have a much bigger team of developers, but `Isnification` is still used regularly. And yes, Isni is still with us, as well as the designer, Art.
